create a class f15 with functions light,fan,AC 
light is called it prints out the color of the light which is taken as parameter to the function
when fan function is called it displays the speed in which it rotates regulator speed pararmeter of the function
when Ac displays the room temp and outside temp which is taken as parameters
wrrite a fourth function that is display difference ofdiplays outside temp and room temp of AC and also displays the fan speed
